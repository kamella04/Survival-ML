# Survival-ML

This is a collaboration project. The dataset contains cases from a study that was conducted between 1958 and 1970 on the survival of patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer. Our objective is to develop a machine learning model using the the data where the dependent variable is survival_status. We have to fit a model to predict the patientâ€™s survival status whether the patient survived 5 years or longer or the patient died within 5 years. We will use Python to train the dataset and find the best classifier.
